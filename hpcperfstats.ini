# The RMQ and Portal sections have been configured to work for the docker installation. You will only need to edit the Default section and the host_name_ext variable under the Portal section, and we recommend editing just these and performing the installation using our instructions. If you need to edit some variables, please note that a lot of them are tied to the docker yml file.
