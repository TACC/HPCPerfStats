Description: 
        TACC Stats unifies and extends the measurements taken by Linux monitoring utilities such as systat/SAR, iostat, etc.~and resolves measurements by job and hardware device so that individual job/applications can be analyzed separately.  It also provides a set of analysis and reporting tools which analyze TACC Stats resource use data and report jobs/applications with low resource use efficiency. TACC Stats initializes at the beginning of a job and collects data at specified intervals during job execution and at the end of a job. When executed at the default interval (every 10 minutes), the overhead is less than 0.1\%. This low overhead enables TACC Stats to be active on all nodes at all times. This data can then be used to generate analyses and reports such as average cycles per instruction (CPI), average and peak memory use, average and peak memory bandwidth use, and more on each job and over arbitrary sets of jobs.   These reports enable systematic identification of jobs or application codes which could benefit from architectural adaptation and performance tuning or catch user mistakes such as allocating multiple nodes to a single-node shared-memory parallelized application.
